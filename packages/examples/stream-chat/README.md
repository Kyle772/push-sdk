# About Stream Chat
Stream chat example shows how you can receive chats when you talk to someone using Push Chat. In this example, we establish a socket connection and then send a message to another user, which also triggers the response back to the old user.

## What's the use case
You can use this example to see the functionality of sockets and how you can respond to messages from backend (server) when a wallet messages you (or a wallet you own). Some use cases are:

- Creating interface for chatting on your frontend
- Enabling your backend to respond to chats or do cool replies automatically
